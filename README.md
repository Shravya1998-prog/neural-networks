# Neural Network Assignment - CS5720
## University of Central Missouri
### Student Name: Nagabandi shravya
### Course: CS5720 - Neural Networks and Deep Learning
### Semester: Spring 2025

##  Overview
This project contains the implementation of various neural network tasks using TensorFlow and Google Colab.

###  Tasks Covered:
1. **Tensor Manipulations & Reshaping**
   - Created a random tensor, reshaped, transposed, and performed broadcasting.

2. **Loss Functions & Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Implemented Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Categorical Cross-Entropy (CCE) loss functions.
   - Modified predictions and compared loss values.

3. **Train a Model with Adam & SGD Optimizers**
   - Trained a neural network on the MNIST dataset with Adam and SGD.
   - Compared accuracy trends using Matplotlib.

4. **TensorBoard Logging**
   - Implemented TensorBoard logging for loss and accuracy visualization.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab
- GitHub

## How to Run:
1. Download the `.ipynb` file from this repository.
2. Open it in **Google Colab**.
3. Run all the cells sequentially.

##  Results:
- Plots comparing MSE and Cross-Entropy loss.
- Training accuracy comparison between Adam and SGD.
- TensorBoard visualizations for training logs.
